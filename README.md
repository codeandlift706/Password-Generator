# Password-Generator
The goal of creating a Password-Generator through the web browser is to provide a source for users to retrieve a random password that fits the unique criteria. The content of the web page itself contains a button to “Generate Password”, and a text box that will generate the random code.
The deployed application can be found here: https://codeandlift706.github.io/Password-Generator/.
